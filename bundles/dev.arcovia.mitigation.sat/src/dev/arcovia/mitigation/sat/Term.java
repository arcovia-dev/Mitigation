/**
 * Represents a term consisting of a specific domain and an associated composite label. The {@code Term} class is a
 * record that combines a domain string with a {@link CompositeLabel}, which encapsulates a label category and its
 * label. The term provides a structured way of expressing the relationship between a domain and the associated
 * composite label. The class overrides the {@code toString()} method to provide a meaningful representation of the
 * term. Specifically: - If the {@code compositeLabel} category is {@code Node}, the string representation indicates
 * that the domain "has Property" corresponding to the label. - For other categories, the representation highlights the
 * label associated with a pin identified by the domain.
